Key insights that could provide value for the CITIBIKE business include:
- What amount of bike rentals occur at different bike stations around the city?
- Do subscribers or customers use the bike rental system more often?
- What time of day do is the service most used and at what stations?
- What duration are the bikes rented for and how does that differ between subscribers and customers?
